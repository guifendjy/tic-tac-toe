# tic-tac-toe
 A 2 player tic tac toe game
I tried to make an AI using the minimax algorithm but It's not working, it's not acting right.
the code is still in the jav.js file but it's not in use. any suggestion is welcome.

sept 30, 2023-- kinda fixed the ai but it's slow on the first move.

july 2, 2024-- recreated the App, its dynamicly rendered on page load with javascript, 
I implemented a server to handle websocket connections.
I used Navigo for the front end router.
your're welcome to fork it and try it out, any suggestions are welcome.

- fork it,
- open it on your machine
- open console and run npm install (that should take care of any dependencies)
- then npm run dev (that should open your default browser).
