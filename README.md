# tic-tac-toe

A 2 player tic tac toe game
I tried to make an AI using the minimax algorithm but It's not working, it's not acting right.
the code is still in the jav.js file but it's not in use. any suggestion is welcome.

sept 30, 2023-- kinda fixed the ai but it's slow on the first move.

apr 3 2024-- i fixed the AI and it is unbeatable.(I mistakenly set the human player as the maximizing player in the minimax algorithm, so the ai kept picking the moves with the lowest score for itself)
try it out. https://guifendjy.github.io/tic-tac-toe/
